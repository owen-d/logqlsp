Can impl ParseError trait if need more control: https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom/blob/main/doc/error_management.md

# Expected errors
{job!"foo"}
    | expected one of (=, !=, =~, !~)
 | while building matcher
 | while building matchers
| while building selector
| while building logSelectorExpr
| while building expr
